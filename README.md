Dynamic User Interface Interactions section from The Odin Project (Javascript path)

## Dropdown Menu
Vertical drop-down made by changing the `max-height` of the collapsible element. Can be activated on either hover or click. Optionally takes CSS input from the user.

## Mobile Menu
Simple menu that utilises a similar concept to the dropdown menu. Added a dimming effect for the rest of the document.

## Image Slider
Modular image slider that can be formed with just an array of `img` elements (of any length). Includes automatic scrolling, forward/backward buttons, as well as specific navigation buttons.

### Thoughts:
This wasn't an official project in the Odin Project's path, but it still took me a while (7~ hours to implement). Overall got much more comfortable with basic transitions in CSS. It was definitely a good exercise to brush up on my CSS/JS skills.
